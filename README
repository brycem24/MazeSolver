A pathfinding implementation that finds the shortest path through the 
maze to demonstrate my understanding of the basics of AI. The algorithm 
used for pathfinding was the A* algorithm. The maze was 
generated with the Growing Tree Algorithm in the style of the Recursive 
Back Tracker Method. This was written in C#.

Written from the start of winter break 2015, and finished in early 
January 2016.
